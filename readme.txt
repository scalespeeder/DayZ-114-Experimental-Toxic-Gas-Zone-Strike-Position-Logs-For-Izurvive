DayZ 1.14 EXPERIMENTAL Chernarus & Livonia Dynamic Toxic Gas Position Logs To Be Used With Izurvive Map

PLEASE NOTE these logs are created from the DayZ EXPERIMENTAL 1.14 xml files. Positions may change with full release of 1.14 and
with furture updates!

ALTHOUGH I AM SURE that with the full release of Toxic Gas Zones, the Izurvive maps will be updated to included their positions.

Download the files from my github by clicking on the Green "Code" button, then "Download Zip"

Extract the zipped file on your local PC.

Go to https://dayz.ginfo.gg/ on your browser and select the correct map, DayZ Chernarus or Livonia.

Click on "Serverlogs" near the top of the screen.

Click "Upload Logfile". Locate where you unzipped the previous downloads and upload the correct .adm file.

If the black markers do not appear, check that in the "filters" drop down menu, "Death (Status)" is ticked.

Travel safely and build your base where it won't get attacked randomly by Toxic Gas Strikes!

I've included a couple of images of the dynamic toxic zones, and XMLS files with the positions, for your information.

Hope this helps!

Rob.
